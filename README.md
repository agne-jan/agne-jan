ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Agne, a business student with interest in computer science.
I am not a developer and the projects here are not meant to be an 
example of perfect coding. They show my journey in learning how to
code.

The code uploaded is Java only; I have also done some class projects 
in C++. Those projects are not shared in public due to professor
having made those private projects and them containing large amounts
of his code. My (and in the same way other classmates) contributions
were the parts that correspond to various topics, such as:
- Doubly linked lists
- Reverse linked lists
- Arrays
- Recursion
- Binary search trees
- Operator overloading

Database projects were done as part of the group so to respect privacy, 
I did not upload them. We learned:
- php (using MyPHPAdmin)
- SQL 
- NoSQL
- creating database schemas (ORM and logical models)
- Relational Algebra
